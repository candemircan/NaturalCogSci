Here, I compute the CKA between:

1. Task embedding and all other representations.
2. All CLIP representations and every other representation

Below are three scripts.
The bash script calls the slurm file (this is for parallelisation on the cluster).
The slurm file calls the Python script.

```{.bash include="../bin/cka.sh"}
```

```{.bash include="../bin/cka.slurm"}
```

```{.python include="../bin/cka-script"}
```
