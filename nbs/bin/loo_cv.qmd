Using the predictions of the learning models, perform a loo-cv, where each trial serves once as the only observation in the test set.

Below are three scripts.
The bash script calls the slurm file (this is for parallelisation on the cluster).
The slurm file calls the R script.

```{.bash include="../bin/loo_cv.sh"}
```


```{.bash include="../bin/loo_cv.slurm"}
```

```{.r include="../bin/loo-cv-script.R"}
```
