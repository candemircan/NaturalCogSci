title: Extract Features From DNNs

Here, I extract features from various DNNs.
The relevant functions are called from `NaturalCogSci.feature_extractors`.
After each image, the extracted features are saved under the `data/temp`directory.
These features are later combined in the script under the `data/features`directory.
This is because our GPUs are not large enough.

Below are three scripts.
The bash script calls the slurm file (this is for parallelisation on the cluster).
The slurm file calls the Python script.

```{.bash include="../bin/extract_features.sh"}
```

Note that the slurm script below loads the models and runs inference using GPUs.

```{.bash include="../bin/extract_features.slurm"}
```

```{.python include="../bin/extract-features-script"}
```
