Here, I run the learning models written in `NaturalCogSci.learners`. All the combinations of the following are ran and saved:

1. All representations (50)
2. L1 and L2 regularised models
3. Original and PCA derived features

Below are three scripts.
The bash script calls the slurm file (this is for parallelisation on the cluster).
The slurm file calls the Python script.


```{.bash include="../bin/run_learners.sh"}
```

```{.bash include="../bin/run_learners.slurm"}
```

```{.python include="../bin/run-learners-script"}
```
